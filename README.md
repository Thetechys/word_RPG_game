# word_RPG

# this is a word based RPG game
# currently there's 1 type of character(class) in game (warrior) while there are 2 instance of each class (warrior)
# character with 0 or below health point will not able to attack or be attacked (dead)
# if player trying to attack a dead character, his/her turn to attack considered wasted
# damage cause = (attacker's attack point) - (defender's defence point)


Future plan :
1. Import pygame so this will be a game with graphic
2. Introduce 'chances' - there are chances attacker's attack completly missed
3. Introduce 'rage' - defender will gain point of rage - able to release 'ultimate skill' some rage point is sufficient
